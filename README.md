## Resources
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4885999/with-github-how-do-i-push-all-branches-when-adding-an-existing-repo) I wanted to look up how to push all branches and tags at once.

## Comments
* Glad to finally get some information on responsive design, I will definitely be utilizing media queries in my future designs.
* Instructions weren't quite clear on whether or not to place "display", but since it didn't, I figure the implied "all" would be fine.
* Getting a little more comfortable with GitHub, specifically pushing information.
* Still not sure if the README file should be in the master, or uploaded to all branches.
* Placed Meta Viewport code only on the index of branches with css media queries.
